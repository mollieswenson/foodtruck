# FoodTruck API

This FoodTruck API uses Node.js, Express, ES6, and MongoDB. I created this as part of Udemy course Beginner API Development in Node. The API allows GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE over HTTPS and includes authentication. Check out the docs!

# Docs

This single-page html [API documentation](https://mollieswenson.github.io/slate/) includes Node (JavaScript), Python, and cURL code samples for all GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API operations, as well as info on authentication, errors, and an overview. It is written in Markdown and published using Slate.
